<H1>Writing a good grant proposal </H1>Simon Peyton Jones and Alan Bundy 
</CENTER>
<P>Writing a good research grant proposal is  not easy. This document is an 
attempt to collect together a number of  suggestions about what makes a good 
proposal. It is inevitably a personal view  on the part of the authors; we would 
welcome feedback and suggestions from  others.  
<H2>APPROACHING A PROPOSAL </H2>The first and most obvious thing to do is to 
 read the advice offered by your funding agency. In the case of EPSRC, the 
 primary funding body for computing science research, there is a "Guide to EPSRC 
 Research Grants". We make no attempt to duplicate the material in the EPSRC 
 guide or any other; you must get yourself a copy and follow the guidance 
 closely.  
<P>The most substantial part of any grant application is some form of "Case for 
 Support". It is this case which will persuade, or fail to persuade, your 
funding  body of the value of your proposal. Proposals range very widely indeed 
in their  quality. You can improve your chances enormously simply by ruthlessly 
writing  and rewriting. This document is entirely about improving your case for 
support.  
<P>There are two vital facts to bear in mind:  
<UL>
  <LI>Your case for support will, with luck, be read by one or two experts in   
  your field. But the programme manager, and most members of the panel that   
  judges your proposal against others, won't be expert. You must, must, must   
  write your proposal for their benefit too.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>Remember that programme managers and panel members see tens or hundreds of 
    cases for support, so you have one minute or less to grab your reader's   
  attention. </LI></UL>Based on these facts, here are two Golden Rules:  
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Ask lots of people to help you improve your proposal</EM>. Give it to  
   your colleagues, your friends, your spouse, your dog, and listen to what they 
    say. If they misunderstand what you were trying to say, don't say "you   
  misunderstood me"; instead rewrite it so it can't be misunderstood. If they   
  don't immediately see the value of what you want to achieve, rewrite it until  
   they do. And so on.    
  <P>This isn't a big demand to make on someone. Ask them to read your proposal  
   for 10 minutes, and say what they think. Remember, most committee members 
  will   give it less time than that.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Make sure that the first page acts as a stand-alone summary of the   
  entire proposal.</EM> Assume (it's a safe assumption) that many readers will   
  get no further than the first page. So don't fill it up with boilerplate about 
    the technical background. Instead, present your whole case: what you want to 
    do, why it's important, why you will succeed, how much it will cost, and so  
   on. </LI></UL>
<H2>CRITERIA FOR A GOOD GRANT PROPOSAL </H2>Most funding agencies apply similar 
 criteria to the evaluation of proposals. We discuss these below. It is 
important  to address these criteria directly in your case for support. A 
proposal which  fails to meet them will be rejected regardless of the quality of 
its source.  Otherwise, there is a danger of discriminating unfairly in favour 
of well-known  applicants.  
<H3>Major criteria </H3>Here are the major criteria against which your proposal 
 will be judged. Read through your case for support repeatedly, and ask whether 
 the answers to the questions below are clear, even to a non-expert.  
<UL>
  <LI><EM>Does the proposal address a well-formulated problem</EM>?  
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Is it a research problem</EM>, or is it just a routine application of  
   known techniques?    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Is it an important problem, whose solution will have useful   
  effects?</EM>   
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Is special funding necessary to solve the problem, or to solve it   
  quickly enough</EM>, or could it be solved using the normal resources of a   
  well-found laboratory?    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Do the proposers have a good idea on which to base their work?</EM>   
  The proposal must explain the idea in sufficient detail to convince the reader 
    that the idea has some substance, and should explain why there is reason to  
   believe that it is indeed a good idea. It is absolutely not enough merely to  
   identify a wish-list of desirable goals (a very common fault). There must be  
   significant technical substance to the proposal.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Does the proposal explain clearly what work will be done?</EM> Does it 
    explain what results are expected and how they will be evaluated? How would 
  it   be possible to judge whether the work was successful?    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Is there evidence that the proposers know about the work that others   
  have done on the problem?</EM> This evidence may take the form of a short   
  review as well as representative references.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Do the proposers have a good track record, both of doing good research 
    and of publishing it?</EM> A representative selection of relevant 
  publications   by the proposers should be cited. Absence of a track record is 
  clearly not a   disqualifying characteristic, especially in the case of young 
  researchers, but   a consistent failure to publish raises question marks. 
</LI></UL>
<H3>Secondary criteria </H3>Some secondary criteria may be applied to separate 
 closely-matched proposals. It is often essentially impossible to distinguish in 
 a truly objective manner among such proposals and it is sad that it is 
necessary  to do so. The criteria are ambiguous and conflict with each other, so 
the  committee simply has to use its best judgement in making its 
recommendations.  
<UL>
  <LI>An applicant with little existing funding may deserve to be placed ahead   
  of a well- funded one. On the other hand, existing funding provides evidence   
  of a good track record.    
  <P></P>
  <LI>There is merit in funding a proposal to keep a strong research team   
  together; but it is also important to give priority to new researchers in the  
   field.    
  <P></P>
  <LI>An attempt is made to maintain a reasonable balance between different   
  research areas, where this is possible.    
  <P></P>
  <LI>Evidence of industrial interest in a proposal, and of its potential for   
  future exploitation will usually count in its favour. The closer the research  
   is to producing a product the more industrial involvement is required and 
  this   should usually include some industrial contribution to the project. The 
  case   for support should include some `route to market' plan, ie you should 
  have   thought about how the research will eventually become a product ---   
  identifying an industrial partner is usually part of such a plan.    
  <P></P>
  <LI>A proposal will benefit if it is seen to address recommendations of   
  Technology Foresight. It is worth looking at the relevant Foresight Panel   
  reports and including quotes in your case for support that relate to your   
  proposal. </LI></UL>
<H3>Cost-effectiveness </H3>Finally, the programme manager tries to ensure that 
 his or her budget is to be used in a cost-effective manner. Each proposal which 
 has some chance of being funded is examined, and the programme manager may lop 
 costs off an apparently over-expensive project.Such cost reduction is likely to 
 happen if the major costs of staff and equipment are not given clear, 
individual  justification.  
<H2>COMMON SHORTCOMINGS </H2>Here are some of the ways in which proposals often 
 fail to meet these criteria.  
<UL>
  <LI><EM>It is not clear what question is being addressed by the proposal</EM>. 
    In particular, it is not clear what the outcome of the research might be, or 
    what would constitute success or failure. It is vital to discuss what   
  contribution to human knowledge would be made by the research.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The question being addressed is woolly or ill-formed</EM>. The   
  committee are looking for evidence of clear thinking both in the formulation   
  of the problem and in the planned attack on it.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>It is not clear why the question is worth addressing</EM>. The   
  proposal must be well motivated.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposal is just a routine application of known techniques</EM>.   
  Research funding agencies are interested in funding research rather than   
  development. Industry are expected to fund development work. The LINK scheme   
  is appropriate for proposals which combine both research and development. If   
  the development would benefit another research field, rather than industry,   
  then look to the funding agencies of that field.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>Industry ought to be doing it instead</EM>. If the work is `near   
  market' then it should be done by industry or industry or venture capital   
  should be funding you to do it. If no industry is interested then the prima   
  facie assumption is that the product has no commercial value.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>There is no evidence that the proposers will succeed where others have 
    failed</EM>. It is easy enough to write a proposal with an exciting-sounding 
    wish-list of hoped-for achievements, but you must substantiate your goals 
  with   solid evidence of why you have a good chance of achieving them.    
  <P>This evidence generally takes two main forms:    
  <UL>
    <P>
    <LI>"We have an idea". In this case, you should sketch the idea, and     
    describe preliminary work you have done which shows that it is indeed a good 
        idea. You are unlikely to get funding without such evidence. It is not 
    good     saying "give us the money and we will start thinking about this 
    problem".      
    <P></P>
    <LI>"We have a good track record". Include a selective list of publications, 
        and perhaps include a short paper (preferably a published one) which 
    gives     more background, as an appendix. If you make it clear that it is 
    an     appendix, you won't usually fall foul of any length limits. </LI></UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>A new idea is claimed but insufficient technical details of the idea   
  are given for the committee to be able to judge whether it looks   
  promising</EM>. Since the committee cannot be expert in all areas there is a   
  danger of overwhelming them with technical details, but it is better to err by 
    overwhelming them than by underwhelming them. They will usually get an 
  expert   referee to evaluate your idea.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposers seem unaware of related research</EM>. Related work must 
    be mentioned, if only to be dismissed. Otherwise, the committee will think   
  that the proposers are ignorant and, therefore, not the best group to fund.   
  The case for support should have a list of references like any paper, and you  
   should look at it to check it has a balanced feel - your referee will do so.  
   Do not make the mistake of giving references only to your own work!    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposed research has already been done - or appears to have been  
   done</EM>. Rival solutions must be discussed and their inadequacies revealed. 
     
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposal is badly presented, or incomprehensible to all but an   
  expert in the field</EM>. Remember that your proposal will be read by   
  non-experts as well as (hopefully) experts. A good proposal is simultaneously  
   comprehensible to non-experts, while also convincing experts that you know   
  your subject. Keep highly-technical material in well-signposted section(s);   
  avoid it in the introduction.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposers seem to be attempting too much for the funding requested 
    and time-scale envisaged</EM>. Such lack of realism may reflect a poor   
  understanding of the problem or poor research methodology.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposal is too expensive for the probable gain</EM>. If it is   
  easy to see how to cut the request for people/equipment/travel, etc. to   
  something more reasonable then it might be awarded in reduced form. More   
  likely, it will be rejected.    
  <P></P>
  <LI><EM>The proposers institution should be funding it</EM>. Research agencies 
    will usually only fund research that requires resources beyond that which   
  might be expected in a "well-found laboratory" --- indeed, this is part of the 
    charter of the research councils. If it looks like your proposal might be 
  done   by a PhD student on the departmental computer then that is what should 
  happen.   If the proposer's laboratory is not "well-found" then this is taken 
  to be a   vote of no-confidence in the proposer by his/her institution.  
</LI></UL>Doubtless there are other common grounds for failure that have been 
 omitted. If you know of any please let us know!.  
<P>Often, one can tell from independent knowledge of the proposers or by reading 
 between the lines of the proposal, that the criteria could have been met if a 
 little bit more thought had gone into the proposal. There is a clear question 
 being addressed by the research, but the proposers failed to clarify what it 
 was. The proposers are aware of related research, but they failed to discuss it 
 in the proposal. The proposers do have some clear technical ideas, but they 
 thought it inappropriate to go into such detail in the proposal. Unfortunately, 
 there is a limit to which a funding agencies can give such cases the benefit of 
 the doubt. It is not fair for referees to overlook shortcomings in proposals of 
 which they have personal knowledge if similar shortcomings are not overlooked 
in  proposals which they have not encountered before. In any case, proposals 
which  <EM>do</EM> meet the criteria deserve precedence.  
<H2>CONCLUSION </H2>We hope that this document will help you to write better 
 grant proposals, and hence to be more successful in obtaining funds for your 
 research. This article is not just about writing better grant proposals to 
 obtain more money. The basic set-up of peer-reviewed grants of limited duration 
 is a sensible one. It compels researchers regularly to review and re-justify 
the  direction of their work. Behind poorly presented grant proposals often lie 
 poorly-reasoned research plans. Perhaps if we can improve the quality of 
 Computer Science proposals we will also improve the quality of Computer Science 
 research.
